Release of Galginax's Scroll of Sorcery!


April 11th, 2024


The Evil Wizard Galginax brings to you mortals his latest findings in his studies of sorcerers and casters as a whole!
Most of this is Sorcerer variant rules but I did give you non-sorcerer players a change to have fun with wild magic with a feature that replaces your normal spellcasting! (it works almost exactly like the normal spellcasting with some differences of course) though it is incompatible with spellpoints, you should be able to have some fun with it!

## Additions

- added Expanded Sorcery Variant Rule
- added Wild Magic Spellcasting Replacement Feature
- added two new Sorcerer Bloodlines; Vampiric and Runic bloodline.
