Bard release 1.2

March 19th 2024

Not too many changes but ive mostly added things this patch, most of this stuff has to do with the healing subclass ive added College Of Health! But theres some stuff for the rest of you bard players out there! :)

Fixes:

- Changed Back From The Brink so that it is no longer a 7th level class feature (woops); and is now a 14th level feature. 

- Physicians can no longer keep someone alive indefinitely, Back From the Brink now has a limit of how many times you can use it per long rest.


Additions:

- Gave Bard the ability to learn from a spellbook/spellscrolls! (a variant rule of course, remember to ask your DM if you can use this; because it might make your wizard feel lame!)

- Gave College of Health an Optional Feature (ask your DM before using this!) at level 6th that lets you make the most out of your potions!
