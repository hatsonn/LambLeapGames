Hey! if you can read this it means you can read! congrats!
This is to aide in reading the homebrew from this folder; All features which are highlighted are features which are in the default class (or in a subclass) which have been changed in *some* way.
Everything in Italics is a new class feature; this does not apply to new subclasses as that would be redundant.
